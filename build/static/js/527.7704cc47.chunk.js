Android applications can only run on Android devices but web applications can not only run on the web browser but also on mobile devices. Thousands of apps are conducted with React Native, including Facebook, Microsoft Office, Discord, and more! Also, with web responsive development support, developers can make their web applications look perfect on all-size devices!! So it's not hard to understand why HTML/CSS/JS/React is required for UX engineers and Design Technologists!! \nSo far I've achieved 4 certificates: Introduction to front-end development, Programming with Javascript, HTML, and CSS in depth, and React Basics. And to practice what I learned in this course and learn more front-end development skills, I also developed this website with React from 0 to 1 and deployed it to GitHub.

However, I don't know which lipstick is suitable for my sister, so I just bought a random one. And as a result, my sister didn't like the color of the lipstick very much. Based on this problem, I designed and developed Feca, which is an android software that uses face recognition technology to help users try virtual makeup.\nThe main function of Feca is virtual makeup Users can upload a photo and then try different cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow, blush, etc. By using Feca, they can figure out what is the best cosmetics for them without going to the mall. Another main function of this software is the makeup forum. In the forum, users can post his/her makeup diary, share the results of using different cosmetics, and recommend cosmetics.\nI participated Chinese National Software Design Contest with Feca and won the first prize out of 7445 teams and the most investment value prize.",github:"https://github.com/Bobkong/Feca",timeline:"January 2018 - May 2018",takeaway:""},{projectName:"Mecat",video:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQWRpgp7JJo",language:"Robotics: Arduino, Processing",type:"Course Project",about:"A medical and emotional care robot, which can give pills and tell stories.",github:"",timeline:"April 2022",takeaway:""}];function u(e){if(null!=e.github&&""!=e.github)return(0,d.jsx)("div",{id:"develop-github",onClick:function(){window.open(e.github)},style:{cursor:"pointer"},children:"VIEW GITHUB REPO"})}function h(e){if(null!=e.video&&""!=e.video)return(0,d.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,d.jsx)("p",{className:"title-color title-size",children:"Video"}),(0,d.jsx)("div",{className:"player-wrapper margin-top-one-rem",children:(0,d.jsx)(o.Z,{url:e.video,className:"react-player",width:"100%",height:"100%",controls:!0})})]})}function m(e){if(null!=e.projectName&&"Tencent Music"==e.projectName)return(0,d.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,d.jsx)("p",{className:"title-color title-size",children:"Feedback about Me"}),(0,d.jsx)("img",{id:"qqmusic-feedback",src:n}),(0,d.jsx)("p",{className:"title-color title-size",children:"My Lovely Team"}),(0,d.jsxs)("div",{id:"qqmusic-team",children:[(0,d.jsx)("img",{id:"qqmusic-team-img",src:s}),(0,d.jsx)("img",{id:"qqmusic-team-img",src:r})]})]})}function p(e){if(null!=e.projectName&&"Personal Website"==e.projectName)return(0,d.jsx)("div",{children:(0,d.jsx)("img",{id:"qqmusic-feedback",src:c})})}function g(e){if(null!=e.takeaway&&""!=e.takeaway)return(0,d.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,d.jsx)("p",{className:"title-color title-size",children:"Takeaway"}),(0,d.jsx)("p",{className:"body-color body-size",style:{whiteSpace:"pre-wrap",lineHeight:1.5},children:e.takeaway})]})}var f=function(e){var t=(0,a.TH)().state;console.log(t.name);var i=l.find((function(e){return e.projectName==t.name}));return(0,d.jsxs)("div",{id:"dev-work-div",children:[(0,d.jsx)("p",{className:"title-color extra-title-size",id:"dev-project-name",children:i.projectName}),(0,d.jsxs)("p",{className:"body-color sub-title-size",id:"dev-timeline",children:[i.type," / ",i.timeline]}),(0,d.jsxs)("span",{className:"sub-body-color body-size",children:["Tech Stack - ",i.language]}),(0,d.jsx)(u,{github:i.github}),(0,d.jsx)("hr",{id:"divide-line"}),(0,d.jsx)("p",{className:"title-color title-size",children:"About"}),(0,d.jsx)("p",{className:"body-color body-size",style:{whiteSpace:"pre-wrap",lineHeight:1.5},children:i.about}),(0,d.jsx)(p,{projectName:i.projectName}),(0,d.jsx)(h,{video:i.video}),(0,d.jsx)(m,{projectName:i.projectName}),(0,d.jsx)(g,{takeaway:i.takeaway})]})}}}]);
