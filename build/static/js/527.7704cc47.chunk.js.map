Android applications can only run on Android devices but web applications can not only run on the web browser but also on mobile devices. Thousands of apps are conducted with React Native, including Facebook, Microsoft Office, Discord, and more! Also, with web responsive development support, developers can make their web applications look perfect on all-size devices!! So it's not hard to understand why HTML/CSS/JS/React is required for UX engineers and Design Technologists!! \\nSo far I've achieved 4 certificates: Introduction to front-end development, Programming with Javascript, HTML, and CSS in depth, and React Basics. And to practice what I learned in this course and learn more front-end development skills, I also developed this website with React from 0 to 1 and deployed it to GitHub. \", \n    github: 'https://github.com/Bobkong/portfolio/tree/main/portfolio',\n    timeline: \"September 2022 - October 2022\",\n    takeaway: \"\"},\n\n    // EasyMed\n    {projectName: \"EasyMed\"},\n\n    // ARamsay\n    {projectName: \"ARamsay\"},\n\n    // Super Plant\n    {projectName: \"Super Plant\", \n    video: \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-v5pJUZQVU\", \n    language: \"Cocos2D-x: C#\", \n    type: \"Course Project\", \n    about: \"A Cocos 2D game combining Super Mario and Plants vs. Zombies.\", \n    github: 'https://github.com/Bobkong/cocos2dx-PlantVsZombieRPG',\n    timeline: \"October 2017 - December 2017\",\n    takeaway: \"\"},\n\n    // Feca\n    {projectName: \"Feca\", \n    video: \"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YTFJCQCsYi4\", \n    language: \"Android: Java, Kotlin, XML\", \n    type: \"Chinese National Software Design Contest\", \n    about: \"When I traveled around the United States, I wanted to buy lipstick as a gift for my sister's birthday. However, I don't know which lipstick is suitable for my sister, so I just bought a random one. And as a result, my sister didn't like the color of the lipstick very much. Based on this problem, I designed and developed Feca, which is an android software that uses face recognition technology to help users try virtual makeup.\\nThe main function of Feca is virtual makeup Users can upload a photo and then try different cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow, blush, etc. By using Feca, they can figure out what is the best cosmetics for them without going to the mall. Another main function of this software is the makeup forum. In the forum, users can post his/her makeup diary, share the results of using different cosmetics, and recommend cosmetics.\\nI participated Chinese National Software Design Contest with Feca and won the first prize out of 7445 teams and the most investment value prize.\", \n    github: 'https://github.com/Bobkong/Feca',\n    timeline: \"January 2018 - May 2018\",\n    takeaway: \"\"},\n\n    // Mecat\n    {projectName: \"Mecat\", \n    video: \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQWRpgp7JJo\", \n    language: \"Robotics: Arduino, Processing\", \n    type: \"Course Project\", \n    about: \"A medical and emotional care robot, which can give pills and tell stories.\", \n    github: '',\n    timeline: \"April 2022\",\n    takeaway: \"\"},];\n\nfunction GithubRepo(props) {\n    if (props.github != null && props.github != \"\") {\n        return (\n        <div id=\"develop-github\" onClick={() => {window.open(props.github)}} style={{ cursor: \"pointer\" }}>\n        VIEW GITHUB REPO\n        </div>);\n    }\n}\n\nfunction VideoPlayer(props) {\n    if (props.video != null && props.video != \"\") {\n        return (\n        <div>\n            <p className='title-color title-size'>Video</p>\n            <div className=\"player-wrapper margin-top-one-rem\">\n                <ReactPlayer\n                url={props.video}\n                className=\"react-player\"\n                width=\"100%\"\n                height=\"100%\"\n                controls={true}\n                />\n            </div>\n        </div>);\n    }\n}\n\nfunction QQMusic(props) {\n    if (props.projectName != null && props.projectName == \"Tencent Music\") {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <p className='title-color title-size'>Feedback about Me</p>\n                <img id=\"qqmusic-feedback\" src={QQMusicFeedback} />\n                <p className='title-color title-size'>My Lovely Team</p>\n                <div id='qqmusic-team'>\n                    <img id=\"qqmusic-team-img\" src={QQMusicTeam1} />\n                    <img id=\"qqmusic-team-img\" src={QQMusicTeam2} />\n                </div>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n        );\n    }\n}\n\nfunction PersonalWebsite(props) {\n    if (props.projectName != null && props.projectName == \"Personal Website\") {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <img id=\"qqmusic-feedback\" src={Certificate} />\n            </div>\n            \n        );\n    }\n}\n\nfunction Takeaway(props) {\n    if (props.takeaway != null && props.takeaway != \"\") {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <p className='title-color title-size'>Takeaway</p>\n                <p className='body-color body-size' style={{whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', lineHeight: 1.5}}>{props.takeaway}</p>\n            </div>\n            \n        );\n    }\n}\n\nfunction DevelopWork(props) {\n    const {state} = useLocation();\n    console.log(state.name);\n\n    const project = development.find(item => item.projectName == state.name);\n    return (\n    <div id=\"dev-work-div\">\n        <p className='title-color extra-title-size' id='dev-project-name'>{project.projectName}</p>\n        <p className='body-color sub-title-size' id='dev-timeline'>{project.type} / {project.timeline}</p>\n        <span className='sub-body-color body-size'>Tech Stack - {project.language}</span>\n        <GithubRepo github={project.github}/>\n        <hr id='divide-line'/>\n        <p className='title-color title-size'>About</p>\n        <p className='body-color body-size' style={{whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', lineHeight: 1.5}}>{project.about}</p>\n        <PersonalWebsite projectName={project.projectName} />\n        <VideoPlayer video={project.video}/>\n        <QQMusic projectName={project.projectName} />\n        <Takeaway takeaway={project.takeaway} />\n    </div>);\n}\n\nexport default DevelopWork;"],"names":["development","projectName","video","language","type","about","github","timeline","takeaway","GithubRepo","props","id","onClick","window","open","style","cursor","VideoPlayer","className","url","width","height","controls","QQMusic","src","QQMusicFeedback","QQMusicTeam1","QQMusicTeam2","PersonalWebsite","Certificate","Takeaway","whiteSpace","lineHeight","state","useLocation","console","log","name","project","find","item"],"sourceRoot":""}
